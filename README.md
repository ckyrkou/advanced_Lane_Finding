This video is a demonstration of Term 1 Project: Advanced Lane Finding of the UDACITY Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

The goals / steps of this project were the following:
• Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
• Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
• Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
• Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
• Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
• Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
• Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
• Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

The developed algorithmic pipeline is capable of tracking the lines and finding the position of the vehicle with respect to them

To run the demo just use

Run python3 P4.py 0 to process video

Run python3 P4.py 1 to process images
